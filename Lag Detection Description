Hello people!

This is my first addon released on Scriptfodder, I've made some other small addons aswell but nothing of the scale this is currently.  If you have any suggestions feel free to shoot them at me.

Requirements
------------------------
* ULX
* A GMod Server (ofc)
* Basic knowledge of unzipping and dragging + dropping a folder into the "addons" folder of your GMod Server

Features
------------------------
* !lag command to freeze all players props
* Auto lag detection with configuarable settings with ConVar (sv_lagdet_trigger) and in-game menu (!lagmenu)


Upcomming Features
-----------------------
* Add config file to change the TPS trigger without having to edit the lua file(s) directly.
* Better design for the in-game menu (Overall I feel that it's shitty, but at least it is currently functional)
* Rewrite some of the code ( especially redundant things that have been left there )
